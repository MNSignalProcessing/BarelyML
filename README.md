Markup display for JUCE - Barely a Markup Language

Introducing BarelyML, the markup language nobody asked for but you're getting anyway! As I realized that just implementing a Markdown display for JUCE apps would not give me the features I needed, I combined the features I most liked from different markup languages (e.g. the headers from Markdown and the tables from DokuWiki) and added a simple coloring scheme on top.

As a plus, BarelyMLDisplay can convert simple Markdown to its own syntax on the fly.

Licensed under the very permissive MIT license, in the hope it will be useful to as many people as possible.
